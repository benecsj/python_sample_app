# Project Overview

This is a Python project focused on clean code and test-driven development practices.

## Project Workflow Reference
- Always consider the instructions and practices described in `workflow.md` as part of the coding and testing guidelines.
- Align refactors, feature implementations, and test practices with the documented workflow whenever applicable.

## General Principles
- Write readable, maintainable code following Pythonic conventions.
- Every new function must have a corresponding test written first (TDD).
- Keep each file focused on a single concern or responsibility.
- Avoid side effects in functions unless explicitly needed.

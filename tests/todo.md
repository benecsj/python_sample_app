# Test Enhancement TODO (Pending Only)

## Pending
- Integration tests: consider adding relationships_exist and class/relationship counts where output patterns are stable
- Add more negative assertions (functions_not_exist, structs_not_exist) in selected feature/example tests where meaningful
- Audit remaining tests for model.project_name and file_count; add where missing
- Prefer per-file puml.files.contains_lines for stable checks; expand in any tests that still rely on global contains_elements only

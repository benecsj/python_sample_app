# Large Codebase Example

A simulated large C codebase with multiple modules and complex include hierarchies.

## Description

This example simulates a large C project with:
- Multiple modules and subdirectories
- Complex include hierarchies
- Many files with various C constructs
- Performance testing scenarios
- Deep include relationships

## Input Files

- `core/` - Core module with basic structures
- `utils/` - Utility module with helper functions
- `network/` - Network module with protocol structures
- `database/` - Database module with data structures
- `main.c` - Main application file

## Expected Output

The tool should generate PlantUML diagrams showing:
- Organized output by module structure
- Complex include relationships
- Performance with many files
- Proper handling of deep include hierarchies

## Configuration

Uses include depth 3 and file filtering to demonstrate performance and organization.

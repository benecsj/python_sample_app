# Basic Project Example

A simple C project demonstrating basic structs, functions, and includes.

## Description

This example shows a basic C project with:
- Simple struct definitions
- Function declarations and implementations
- Header file includes
- Global variables
- Basic typedefs

## Input Files

- `main.c` - Main source file with function implementations
- `utils.h` - Header file with function declarations and struct definitions
- `types.h` - Header file with typedef definitions

## Expected Output

The tool should generate a PlantUML diagram showing:
- The main.c file as a source class
- utils.h and types.h as header classes with their content
- Include relationships between files
- All structs, functions, and typedefs properly displayed

## Configuration

Uses default configuration with include depth 1 to show direct includes.
